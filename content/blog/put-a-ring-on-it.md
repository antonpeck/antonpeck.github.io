title: Put a Ring On It

How many of you (the few that will see this) remember blog rings from the early 2000’s? Blog rings, also known as webrings, were a bit of a pre social media way of allowing like-minded people to keep in touch with each other. It was all decentralized, you owned your content, and you could pretty easily cross-link to other blog posts.

## What is a blog ring?

Imagine a dynamic online gathering where bloggers with similar interests come together to form a collaborative network of content and community. This collective is known as a blog ring.

> If you liked it then you shoulda put a ring on it  
> I got gloss on my lips, a man on my hips  
> Got me tighter in my Dereon jeans  
> Acting up, drink in my cup

_No, I don’t mean Beyonce. Though that song is absolutely timeless. What a killer voice, right?_

A blog ring is essentially a group of blogs that revolve around a common theme or topic. Bloggers in the ring share links to each other's posts, creating a chain of interconnected articles. This arrangement allows readers to easily explore various perspectives on the same subject and discover new voices they might not have encountered otherwise. It's like entering a cozy digital cafe where every blog is a unique table with its own special dish of insights and experiences. Whether you're into fashion, travel, DIY projects, or deep philosophical discussions, there's likely a blog ring waiting to welcome you into its captivating web of diverse viewpoints and creative expressions.

Sounds a bit familiar, doesn’t it? Oh yeah… social media!

## So what happened to blogging?

The advent of social media has reshaped the influence of blog rolls. In the early blogging era, these rolls served as lists of recommended blogs, fostering a sense of community and aiding content discovery. However, social media's rise introduced a more interactive way to connect and share content. Bloggers now engage directly with readers on platforms, using real-time discussions and content snippets.

This shift has reduced the prominence of traditional blog rolls, as bloggers now promote content through social media. They build followings and connections within these platforms, altering the way audiences discover content. While blog rolls remain relevant for curated recommendations or as a nod to blogging's history, social media has fundamentally changed how bloggers and readers interact, making direct engagement and content sharing central.

## Is blogging dead?

Dead? No no no… I don’t believe so (at least I hope not). Right now, there are a lot of websites that still blog, it’s just harder to find under the massive noise of everything else on the internet. In order for blogging (and blog rolls) to make a bit of a comeback, a handful of things need to happen:

1. **Original and Diverse Content:** Bloggers need to offer unique insights and engaging narratives to capture readers' interest and stand out in a crowded digital landscape.

1. **Authentic Community Engagement:** Building a genuine connection with readers through meaningful interactions, discussions, and comments can recreate the sense of community that makes blogs special.

1. **Quality Over Quantity:** Prioritizing well-researched, thought-provoking content over frequent updates can establish credibility and set blogs apart from rapid content streams.

1. **SEO and Discoverability:** Implementing strong search engine optimization (SEO) practices can ensure that blogs appear prominently in search results, making them easier to discover.

1. **Effective Social Media Strategy:** Leveraging platforms like [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/pixelhuffer/), [Threads](https://www.threads.net/@pixelhuffer), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antonpeck/), [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/) and others to share snippets, engage with audiences, and drive traffic back to blogs can boost visibility and reach.

### Will you join me?

I was inspired to write this from a post on [Threads from @dkr](https://www.threads.net/@dkr/post/Cvyz7pnuEm2), who wrote:

> Who’s down for an old school blog ring? Maybe we bring RSS back and kick it like we used to before social media was a thing. Once I get my new site up (it might take awhile) I’m enabling comments. LFG.

### So here I am. I’m ready to go. That means the ball, dear reader, is in your court.
