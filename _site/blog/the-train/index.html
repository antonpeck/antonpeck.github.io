    <p>I have another prompt to work from Today!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I saw a man standing on some railroad tracks. I asked him what he was doing.<br>
He said he was waiting.<br>
Suddenly, I heard a train coming and I hold him he needed to get off the tracks, but he doesn’t move.<br>
You’re the old man. Why are you on the tracks and what do you do next?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The air is breezy tonight. Just a little cold, but not too bad. Nothing that a windbreaker can’t beat. Mine is blue. Blue as the eyes of someone I knew many, many years ago. Breezy and just a little cold. I try to remember what I was just doing. My thoughts are like the mist I feel on my skin. There to be felt, but unable to grasp. Where was I just going? Where am I from? These unanswerable questions.</p>
<p>Home… I’m pretty sure I was heading home. But not here… no, not here at all. There. Not here. I forgot how you get there. Especially from here, which is not where I think I am, and certainly not there, or here, or anywhere. Where? No, wait. I’m confused again. But this feels normal. The confusion. It’s okay to be confused. I know this is okay. I know, I know. I may not know much, but I am not confused about the awareness of being confused.</p>
<p>I smile at this amusement.</p>
<p>My ears pick up on a voice carried by the wind. I hear it call out so very faintly, like it’s a whisper just barely touching my neck, or the yell of a person from miles away. Or both. Neither? I cannot tell right now. Nevermind. It’s just the wind, I say to myself. Wind is funny like that. Silly wind, trying to distract me from my journey. My important mission. I’m going… not here. I tell the wind that I am waiting, though I’m not sure for what.</p>
<p>I notice that something is changing. There is a warmth against my skin, like the feeling of the sun coming from everywhere at once. No, not the sun… the universe. All of the suns, everywhere. It’s faint, but beautiful. The magical tingle of stars, working their way through my body. I sense that my journey is almost at an end. Or, just about to begin. We shall see.</p>
<p>The air is breezy tonight. Just a little cold, but not too bad. Nothing that a collection of stardust can’t beat. I don’t recall the point of change, but I am on the move. Riding the air like dust. I am no longer confused about where I am anymore.</p>
<p>I am not here, but I am still smiling.</p>
